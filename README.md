     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Engineering Project Management (GENG 8020) is a foundational graduate course in the Master of Engineering (MEng) program at the University of Windsor. This course focuses on developing the advanced organizational and leadership skills essential for professional engineers, encompassing the project lifecycle, stakeholder governance, resource planning, and strategic decision-making.

### Course Objectives

The curriculum encompasses several key management and engineering domains:
- **Project Lifecycle**: Understanding the conceptualization, execution, and closure of complex engineering projects.
- **Stakeholder Management**: Mastering communication strategies and professional engagement for effective project governance.
- **Planning & Budgeting**: Translating organizational goals into precise schedule and fiscal management frameworks.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Developing the analytical rigor required for proactive identification and management of project constraints.
- **Technical Leadership**: Leveraging project management methodologies to drive successful outcomes in professional engineering environments.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, course assessments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that project management foundations remain essential for solving complex engineering problems and explaining them with technical precision. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental management principles
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Engineering Project Management
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them

> [!NOTE]
> All materials were created, compiled, and organized by me during the Summer 2023 semester as part of my MEng degree requirements.
